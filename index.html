    My name is JaeShawn!!!! If you're reading this currently it means; 
    I have successfully created a string of code to create a test dummy website where i'll be able to start showcasing my skills and progress with computer programming.
    This string of code alone took me about an hour and a half to configure to get it set up and running on a live server. 
    Not to mention adding the progress bar and colorful text for you to enjoy. Thank you for clicking my link and reading this message, I have now started week 1 of 6.
    See you soon, until next time ill be typing away at my keyboard learning to code to make 6 figures within a year.
